    <abstract>
      <t>RFC 6472, published in 2011, recommends against the use of the AS_SET
      and AS_CONFED_SET types of the AS_PATH in BGPv4. This was done to
      simplify the design and implementation of BGP and to make the semantics
      of the originator of a route more clear. This document deprecates both
      AS_SETs, and atomic aggregate from the BGPv4 protocol.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC6472"/>, published in 2011, recommends against the
      use of the AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET types of the AS_PATH in BGPv4. This
      was done to simplify the design and implementation of BGP and to make
      the semantics of the originator of a route more clear. <xref
      target="RFC6472"/>, Section 4 also said:<list>
          <t>"Future work may update the protocol to remove support for the
          AS_SET path segment type of the AS_PATH attribute. This future work
          will remove complexity and code that are not exercised very often,
          thereby decreasing the attack surface."</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This document completes that work by deprecating AS_SETs (and
      AS_CONFED_SETs) from the BGP protocol, allowing "compliant"
      implementations to not implement support for them.</t>

      <t>Here is a reference to an "external" (non-RFC / draft) thing: (<xref
      target="IANA.AS_Numbers"/>). And this is a link to an ID:<xref
      target="I-D.ietf-sidr-iana-objects"/>.</t>

      <section title="Requirements notation">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="MEasurements">
      <t>Measurements performed in 2009 showed that "that aggregation that
      involves AS_SETs is very seldom used in practice on the public network
      [Analysis] and, when it is used, it is usually used incorrectly --
      reserved AS numbers ([RFC1930]) and/or only a single AS in the AS_SET
      are by far the most common case. " <xref target="RFC6472"/> recommended
      that operators not perform aggregation that results in the creation of
      AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET. </t>

      <t>Recent research [[ CITE ]] demonstrates that this RFC is largely
      being followed, and AS_PATHs containing these attributes are very rare,
      and / or nonsensical (e.g AS1 AS2 AS3 { AS3 AS3 AS3 } ). This makes
      AS_SETS, AS_CONFED_SETS, and ATOMIC_AGGREGATE (which relies on AS_SETS)
      a vestigial feature.</t>

      majority of the updates involved simply deleting references to the
